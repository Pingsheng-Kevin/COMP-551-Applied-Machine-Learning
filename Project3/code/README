Please note that since all experiments may not be conducted using the same computing machine
For example, some are run at laptop locally while some are run in google colab VM
So there're multiple versions of notebooks, the majority is the same with a few distinctions.

Most of experiment results are adopted from MLP_v2.ipynb

Also, please note that some experiments take extremely long time to complete, up to 3 days.

GPU/TPU not supported
